    Welcome to my digital portfolio!

        <p>
            This project was started in December 2025 primarily to serve as an opportunity to learn how to develop a website using HTML and CSS. 
            Prior to this project I had zero experience using CSS or HTML. I look forward to improving the design, features, and experience of this website in the future. <br>
        </p>
        <p>    
            Please bear with me as I continue my learning journey.<br>
