    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Jack Merkl and thank you for taking the time to visit my website!<br>
        <br>
        I am an undergradute student at Troy University studying Computer Science. I created this website with the initial intent of learning the basics of HTML and CSS, however, it quickly spiraled into a million "what-if?" possibilities.
        In an effort to satisfy this curiosity, I determined that the best course of action was to create a living portfolio of professional, academic, and personal projects.<br>
        <br>
        As you will hopefully see throughout the website's development, I have a variety of interests that I try to integrate within my projects as a way to motivate myself. Aside from working on the website itself, I have simultaneously been creating a database
        for all of my Magic the Gathering cards with the intent of creating a relational database within a SQL language. If work continues to be completed diligently, I should have that completed and uploaded shortly after the website gets CSS and doesn't look like shit.<br>
